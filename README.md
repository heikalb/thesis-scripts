# Formulaicity of Affixes in Turkish

---
This project contains scripts written for extracting and processing data on 
suffixes in the Turkish National Corpus for a Master's in Linguistics thesis.

## Motivation
The main idea of this project is formulaicity, which is the notion that some
sequences of multiple items (e.g., words) psycholinguistically function as 
units, despite their apparent decompositionality. This thesis project examines 
whether formulaicity also occurs among affixes, using the Turkish National 
Corpus as a dataset. Although formulaicity is a psycholinguistic concept, this
project looks for an evidence for it through the distribution of affixes in a 
corpus.

The main questions explored in this project are:

* Does affix formulaicity exist in the corpus?
* Is affix formulaicity a gradient or discrete phenomenon?
* Does formulaicity also apply to affixes and stems?

One contribution of this study is the method used to capture formulaicity 
between affixes. For this purpose, this study uses a measurement of association
called risk ratio, which is likely have never been used to measure collocation
in corpus studies.
